This repository basically has client sided mods that can be used for minecraft.

PerformanceAndOptifineFeatures.zip adds client sided mods to help with performance along with features that optifine has. Highly recommend to install this zip file if you just want performance.

QualityOfLife.zip are mods that help you in various ways like being able to see your saturation. Install if you want to have to have small advantages over others.

Non_Vanilla.zip is interesting as this adds features that aren't vanilla at all and give major advantages/change to gameplay. May add lag to your game and could be seen as cheating.

litematica-fabric-1.21.10-rc1-0.24.1.jar is a blueprint mod that allows you to make use of schematics. Only install if you know what you're doing. Do not unzip this folder just place it in the mods folder.
